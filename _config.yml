  This is the global sex perverter's registry.
  A sex perverter is an individual who perverts the justice system in the case of laws against sex crimes.  
  Currently there is little to no just consequences for perverting the laws against sex crimes. 
  This registry displays the information of individuals who have filed false accusations of sex crimes the same way those individuals who were falsely accused would have had to register as a sex offender.
